        <span class="blogtopic">My Python project setup basics (with tests and linting)</span>
        <p>
        I have this problem that when I go to start a new Python project, I often realize that I've... forgotten
        some basic things about how I like to set up a Python project. And if, as I get more practice, I'm getting better at remembering those things,
        I'm also having more occasion to explain to someone <em>else</em> how I like to set up a project.
        </p>
        <p>
        So, I put together this post for the dual purpose of 1) replacing (or at least complementing!) the digging around in an old project for templates for myself and trying to remember things I 
        <em>totally used to know how to do</em> and 2) serving as a resource or explainer that I can share with others.
        </p>

            <p class="explanation setup-info">This file contains information and instructions that help your project be installed as a package, for example with pip.
                If you don't expect to distribute your project as a package and don't need it to be easily installable in this way, you likely don't need this file.
            </p>
            <p class="explanation readme-info">The readme gives basic information about the project, including information about installation, usage, how to contribute, and licensing.</p>
            <p class="explanation requirements-info">
                Lists that packages users will need to run the project. You can pin your requirements to specific releases of those libraries as well, by specifying the version as in the example below.

            <p class="explanation init-info">
                You used to need an <span class="code-simple">__init__.py</span> file to mark a directory as a module. But now you don't need it for that. However, you can still use <span class="code-simple">__init__.py</span> to add things to the namespace.
                Note that my example <span class="code-simple">setup.py</span> file looks for a version number within <span class="code-simple">__init__.py</span>.

                Probably you'll have more than just this one file with code, unless it's a very small project. In this example,
                the line <span class="simple-code">__all__ = ["greet", "say_farewell"]</span> controls what gets imported in an <span class="simple-code">import *

               This folder can hold scripts related to the project that you and other developers might like to use. 
               For example, it could include scripts for linting and testing (as in this example), or building documentation, and/or for building a release.

                the formatter <span class="code-simple">black</span> calls itself "uncompromising" &mdash; you might like that it
                takes formatting decisions (and differences of opinion about formatting) out of the equation for you and your collaborators,
                or you might find you'd prefer not to use it because you'd like a little compromise thank-you-very-much.

        <div class="panel">

            If you haven't yet created your conda environment for development, you can create it, activate it, and install pip in it:
                <div><pre class="code-gray">conda env create --name myenvname 
conda activate env myenvname
conda install pip</pre></div>

            Next, with that conda environment activated, install and/or update libraries that your library and development depend on:
                <div><pre class="code-gray">pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
pip install --upgrade -r requirements-dev.txt </pre></div>

            Make sure you have your own module installed in the conda environment, by navigating to the directory containing <span class="code-simple">setup.py</span> and entering:
                <div><pre class="code-gray">pip install -e . </pre></div>
            Note that here the . is here as a path to where pip should look for the relevant <span class="code-simple">setup.py</span> file (i.e. in the same directory you are already in).
        </div>

        <button class="accordion alternative-accordion"> Lint and test locally</button>
        <div class="panel">
            If you've set up scripts to run linting and testing as in the example file tree above, you can run them from within your top-level directory with:
            <div class="code-gray"><pre>
bash scripts/lint_and_test.sh</pre></div>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion alternative-accordion">Inspect test coverage</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>1. Make sure you have <span class="code-simple">pytest</span> and <span class="code-simple">pytest-cov</span> installed in your conda environment 
            (you can install them one by one, but to stay organized and make things easier for your collaborators to use the same tools,
            just make sure they're listed inside <span class="code-simple">requirements-dev.txt</span> as in the example above.)
            </p><p>
            2. Run
            <div class="code-gray"><pre>pytest -vx --cov-report=html --cov myproject</pre></div>
            </p>
            <p>
            3. Once the tests have run, notice that a new directory <span class="code-simple">htmlcov</span> has been created. Open the <span class="code-simple">index.html</span> file
            within this new directory in a browser to get a nice html-based report on your coverage.

            For this step, assuming you have a repository set up on GitHub, you'll add a file to <span class="code-simple">myproject/.github/workflows</span>.
            For example, the following file, which we might name <span class="code-simple">python-package.yaml</span>, would install the necessary
            python dependencies and run the lint and test scripts <span class="code-simple">lint.sh</span> and <span class="code-simple">test.sh</span>, located in the <span class="code-simple">scripts</span> directory
