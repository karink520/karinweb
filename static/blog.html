          <span class="blogtopic" class="include-in-wordcloud"> Learning resources for app development with iOS</span>
          <p class="include-in-wordcloud">Last year I created and taught a class on mobile app development for iOS to high schoolers.  The prerequisite was one term of
          computer science, so all students had done some coding before, although in some cases they were still quite new to coding.  It was a joy to teach coding via app development in part because it was such a motivating experience for students as they
          learned programming to be able to see the results of their creative and problem-solving efforts so quickly and concretely
          on their own phone.<p>

          <p class="include-in-wordcloud">Here are some resources for getting started creating iOS apps with Xcode and Swift.</p>
          <ul>
            <li class="include-in-wordcloud"><a class="green" href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/course/developing-ios-11-apps-with-swift/id1309275316">
              Developing iOS 11 Apps with Swift by Stanford (iTunes U)
            </a>  - So much for saving the best for last.  Stanford very generously has made its lectures and notes available for free through iTunes U.
            This is a GREAT course, and going through it in detail helped my learn what I needed to know in order
            to teach my own course.  It assumes a background in object oriented programming, so might feel a bit fast paced
            if you are still pretty new to programming.  This was not a resource I pointed my students to directly,
            but one I used for my own learning.  Enjoy.

            <li class="include-in-wordcloud"> <a class="green" href="https://nostarch.com/iphoneappsforkids">Coding iPhone Apps for Kids: A Playful Introduction to Swift by Gloria Winquist and Matt McCarthy (No Starch Press, 2017)</a> - Don't let the title throw you off!
              This is a beautifully produced book with wonderfully clear and helpful exposition.  Who - kid or adult - wouldn't appreciate that? The book gives a tour of core ideas of coding in Swift, and then walks through
              the creation of several apps that would give a nice jumping off point for building your own.  It assumes no programming background, but I think it's a great
              resource even if you've done some coding but are just new to Swift.

            App Development with Swift by Apple Education (iBooks)
            </a>
            - This eBook is freely available and assumes no background in coding.  It was a useful resource for my students
            to get a solid grounding in the basics of coding, Swift, and Xcode, and its section on HTTP and URL Sessions
            was particularly helpful in breaking down a complex topic to make it accessible to my students as they built
            their own apps.  Its interactive quiz questions at the end of each chapter were a good way for students to give themselves
            a quick check for understanding.  The book is meant to lend itself well to an academic course structure,
            so if you are a teacher new to the subject (like I was!) it could give helpful ideas for structuring a syllabus.  I found myself wishing that it got to more exciting
            example applications more quickly with its labs and guided projects, especially as I was using it for a ten week course, but with a little
            adaptation it worked out well for us.

            - I haven't spent much time on this site yet - and some of the content seems to have been restructured since I have, but I have this
            on my list of resources to explore more deeply before the next time I teach the course, as it seems to offer
            a number of helpful and practically-orienteed tutorials on different aspects of iOS development and Swift.

              The Swift Programming Language (Apple)
            </a>
            - I found Apple's language guide very clear and helpful for getting to know Swift.  It's concise enough
            that you can reasonably read the whole guide.  If you're on the newer side, you'll learn more about programming
            along the way, and if you've been programming for a long time, I think it will get you pretty quickly into what
            you need to know about Swift in particular.  On its own, it won't teach you how to make apps, but it's a great
            resource to have on hand.

            Human Interface Guidlines (Apple)
          </a>
            - Since I'm coming from a math background, design principles for apps that are enjoyable to use feels pretty out of my
            field.  So, the idea that there are concrete guidelines out there seems magical and reassuring!  I can't say I have delved into all
            of what is here, but each piece I have looked at has given me useful ideas to think about as I look to make and help
            my students make an app that someone would actually want to use!
