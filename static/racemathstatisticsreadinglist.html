        <span class="blogtopic" class="include-in-wordcloud"> A reading list about race and racism in statistics, math, machine learning and data science  </span>
        <p> 
          I put together this reading and viewing list for myself because I am not as far along as I would like to be in my understanding of issues of race and racism 
            as they relate to mathematics, statistics, and data science.  I am posting it here in case it can 
            be helpful to anyone else, and in the hopes that others may contribute more suggestions.
        </p>
        <p>Especially our experience with this fields has primarily been one of privilege, it can be too easy to forget that, for all of their abstraction, math, statistics, and machine learning
          are created by humans and in a human context.  Their development and applications directly affect the injustice or justice of world we all inhabit.</p>
